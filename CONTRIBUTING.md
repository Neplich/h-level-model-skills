# Contributing

This repository maintains four plugins and eight directly usable Skills. Contributions can improve professional methods, tools, installation or documentation.

Work on a branch and preserve unrelated user changes. Synchronize affected registration paths, discovery descriptions, capability directories and lockfile hashes. Verify the behavior that changed. See [Skill maintenance](docs/cookbook/maintain-skills.md) and [architecture](docs/architecture.md).
